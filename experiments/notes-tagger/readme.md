Perfect — thanks for the clear preferences! 🫶  
Here’s the plan based on what you just said:

- ✅ Use **Python** (so you can brush up for work too!)
- ✅ Add a **YAML frontmatter** block
- ✅ Keep it **simple, readable, and modular** so you can easily adapt it later if you want.

# 🐍💬 Here’s your **Python YAML Frontmatter Adder** (First Draft)

```python
import os

# --- Settings ---
root_folder = "PATH_TO_YOUR_NOTES_REPO"  # <-- change this to your notes folder
default_tags_by_folder = {
    "reflections": ["reflection"],
    "onboarding": ["sandbox", "onboarding"],
    "experiments": ["sandbox", "experiment"],
    "technical-notes": ["technical", "sandbox"],
    "creative-notes": ["creative", "sandbox"],
    "future-plans": ["planning", "sandbox"],
}

# --- Script ---
def add_frontmatter(filepath, tags):
    with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        content = f.read()

    if content.lstrip().startswith("---"):
        print(f"Skipping {filepath}: already has frontmatter.")
        return  # Already has YAML frontmatter

    frontmatter = f"---\ntags: [{', '.join(tags)}]\n---\n\n"
    new_content = frontmatter + content

    with open(filepath, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(new_content)

    print(f"Added frontmatter to {filepath}")

def process_folder(folder_path):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(".md"):
                full_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                relative_path = os.path.relpath(full_path, root_folder)
                folder_name = relative_path.split(os.sep)[0]

                tags = default_tags_by_folder.get(folder_name, ["sandbox"])  # fallback tag
                add_frontmatter(full_path, tags)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_folder(root_folder)
```

# 🔧 Quick How-To

1. **Save this as** `add_frontmatter.py` (or whatever you want).
2. **Edit the line**:
   ```python
   root_folder = "PATH_TO_YOUR_NOTES_REPO"
   ```
   Replace `"PATH_TO_YOUR_NOTES_REPO"` with the *absolute path* to your notes folder.
   
   *(example: `"/Users/ash/Documents/gpt-features-knowledgebase"`)*
3. Run it:

   ```bash
   python add_frontmatter.py
   ```

4. It will walk through your repo and **only add YAML frontmatter** to `.md` files that **don't already have it**.

# 📋 Example Before/After

**Before:**

```markdown
# Memory Strategies for GPT
Blah blah...
```

**After running script:**

```markdown
---
tags: [technical, sandbox]
---

# Memory Strategies for GPT
Blah blah...
```

# 🚀 Why This Is Set Up This Way

| Feature | Why |
|:---|:---|
| Skip if already has frontmatter | Avoids messing up manually tagged files later |
| Tags based on top-level folder | Clean, simple first sort |
| Easy to extend later | You can add deeper tagging if you want! |

---

# 🧩 Would you also like a second, **optional version** that detects extra keywords (like "memory", "tone shift", "token") inside filenames or first lines?  
Not required, but it could give you richer tagging if you feel up to playing later. 🌱  

(Or you can just start with this simple version and enjoy the win!)  
How would you like to proceed? 🚀
