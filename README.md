# GPT Features Sandbox Onboarding Repository

## Overview
This repository manages the onboarding documents and protocols for GPT Features Sandbox threads.

These threads are designed for:
- **Exploration**: Testing GPT capabilities in controlled, documented environments
- **Skill Building**: Developing user practices around memory handling, feedback loops, and technical collaboration
- **Creative Experimentation**: Includes technical and narrative testing in areas like system design, writing support, and structured applications

The onboarding document (`Gpt Features Onboarding.md`) provides a full outline of expectations, flagging protocols, memory management procedures, and continuity strategies.

## Intended Workflow

1. **Upload or paste onboarding document at thread start**:
   - Always paste early in a new thread to ground behavior.
   - Re-paste if the session context is lost (e.g., daily resets).

2. **Conduct experimental or operational sandboxing**:
   - Test new model behaviors (marking, memory, thread management).
   - Document or discuss changes as needed directly within the thread.

3. **Periodically update this repository**:
   - Download evolved onboarding documents from active threads.
   - Apply versioning manually (e.g., v1.0 â†’ v1.1) if significant changes are made.
   - Maintain a clear changelog if needed.

## .gitignore Guidance

Use a `.gitignore` to prevent clutter from exported chat logs, local scratchpads, and temporary files. A minimal example is provided separately.

---

## Ethical and Privacy Considerations

- **Confidentiality First**: Assume all sandbox explorations are personal unless confirmed otherwise.
- **Transparency Expected**: Uphold marking guidelines within repository-managed threads.

---

## Future Opportunities

If the GPT Features project scales, future expansions could include:
- Sandbox lineage tracking
- Multi-sandbox comparison tools
- External tooling integrations (e.g., Markdown-to-Git automations)
