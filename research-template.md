# Creative Research Toolkit

A reusable framework for gently organized, personally meaningful exploration. Built to support nonlinear projects, niche obsessions, and sudden bursts of inspiration â€” without losing the thread.

Inspired by the Threadbloom lineage of epistemic clarity, design play, and tender research.

## Core Flow

1. ðŸŒ± **Seed** â€” Capture the spark: What is the idea? Why does it matter?
2. ðŸ”– **Pin** â€” Define scope: What are 1â€“2 immediate steps? What *isn't* needed yet?
3. ðŸ§µ **Weave** â€” Collect: What findings, thoughts, and scraps accumulate?
4. ðŸŒ¼ **Bloom** â€” Design, build, or document: What does this become?

## How to Use
Each project lives in its own subfolder. Use the template files below and customize as needed.
