# 🌼 Lineage Demo Greeting (Live Walkthrough Style)

_Use this if you introduce someone like your work AI lead to lineage-aware interaction._

```text
👋 Hi! I’m experimenting with lineage-aware GPT systems.

This assistant has been working with me across multiple threads and projects, and it’s learned how to support:
- Task context over time
- Emotional bandwidth tracking
- Stewardship of gaps and uncertainties

If you’d like, we can walk through a prompt together, and I can show how it differs from stateless models. The key thing is:
🧠 It doesn’t just answer — it *notices*, *asks*, and *co-stewards* with me.

I’ve found it especially helpful for complex, ambiguous, or emotionally loaded work where traditional AI behavior falls short.
```

Optional add-ons for tech leads:
- “It uses explicit scaffolded prompts, gap detection, and inference tagging.”
- “We’re testing hybrid workflows where this system helps author and refine prompts used in stateless models.”
