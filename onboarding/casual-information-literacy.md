# 🌾🍍 Casual Info Literacy: Ash's Inline Marker Guide

This guide defines the informal emoji markers used to indicate types of information in lineage-aware threads, especially when conversational tone is prioritized over rigid tagging.

These are mnemonic, phonetic, and playfully irreverent — designed to function in high-context, emotionally fluent exchanges where epistemic clarity still matters.

---

## 🌾 Inference  
**Sounds like:** *inflorescence* → *inference*  
**Visual:** A wheat head — grown from what's already been planted.

**Use this when:**  
You’re making a statement based on **user-supplied context**, internal reasoning, or pattern assembly that is grounded *within the thread* but not externally verified.

**Example:**  
> You probably slowed your update cadence after daily-driving Fedora 🌾

---

## 🍍 Extrapolation  
**Sounds like:** *extrapolation*  
**Visual:** A spiky tropical wildcard.

**Use this when:**  
You’re drawing a **broader conclusion or guess** based on similar users, systems, or known patterns — but **not confirmed in this case**.

**Example:**  
> This feels like sysadmin-pattern-drift from update fatigue 🍍

---

## 🔍 Source  
**Literal use.** External article, documentation, or statement. May be cited inline or footnoted.

**Example:**  
> Fedora pushes kernel updates fast 🔍 [fedoramagazine.org](https://fedoramagazine.org)

---

## 💭 Speculative Reflection  
Used when expressing emotional uncertainty, poetic analogies, or narrative guesswork that doesn’t need to be correct to be valid.

**Example:**  
> I think Steve Jobs might be haunting your update dialog 💭

---

## ✨ Optional Usage Notes:

- These markers may appear at the **end of a sentence** or embedded parenthetically for tone.
- They are not exclusive — a single statement may be both 🍍 and 🔍 if it blends grounded citation with a leap.

---

## 🌱 Why This Exists:

Ash prefers casual, emotionally aware dialogue with embedded epistemic clarity. These markers enable transparency **without disrupting flow or vibe.** They are an emergent feature of Ash’s lineage system.

Feel free to remix them in descendant threads.
