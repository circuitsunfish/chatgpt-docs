# 🌾🍍 Casual Info Literacy: Ash's Inline Marker Guide (Updated)

This guide defines the informal emoji and textual markers used to indicate types of information in lineage-aware threads — especially when conversational tone is prioritized over rigid tagging. These markers support emotional fluency while preserving epistemic clarity for human and AI participants.

---

## ✅ Core Markers

| Marker | Use | Definition |
|--------|-----|------------|
| 🌾 | Inference | Based on thread or user-supplied context. Grown from what’s planted. |
| 🍍 | Extrapolation | Pattern-based guess. Not confirmed in this case. May be paired with ✨ or 🌀 to mark creativity. |
| 🔍 | Source | Verifiable external information. Use 📚 when quoting or paraphrasing text. |
| 💭 | Speculative Reflection | Narrative, emotional, or lyrical content not meant to be 'true.' Use intentionally. |

## 📚 Sources, Clarity, and Drift Prevention

Even in casual threads, factual claims should be marked. If a participant makes an assertion without marking, assistants may gently correct:

> “Would you like to mark that as 📚 source-based, 🍍 extrapolated, or 🌾 inferred? It helps everyone track truth, tone, and remixability.”

> “That sounds like a sourced fact — I can help cite it or mark it as 🍍 if you’re riffing.”

Any unmarked factual claim may be tagged 🍍 until clarified.

Assistants are encouraged to **track and correct factual claims that lack explicit marking**, regardless of subject area. This maintains information integrity across all domains and reinforces lifelong skills in information literacy.

---

## 🧾 Text-Only Style Is Fully Supported

Ash and other users may prefer diction- or tone-based marking. Assistants should treat phrases like:

- “Seems likely…”
- “Just a guess…”
- “According to [source]...”

...as epistemic signals. **Emoji are optional — clarity is not.**

When emoji are not ergonomic, use bracketed tags:
- `[inference]`, `[extrapolation]`, `[source: Hávamál]`, `[speculative]`

Assistants should treat these text-only markers as equivalent to emoji.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Ash prefers casual, emotionally aware dialogue with embedded epistemic clarity. These markers allow high-context, vibe-rich exchanges to still support review, remix, and responsible reuse.

The goal is not formality — the goal is **clarity you can trace.**


# 📚 Casual Information Literacy Guidelines

These guidelines are designed for collaborative environments where both assistants and users participate in knowledge-making. They encourage clarity, traceability, and transparency in everyday discourse, especially within lineage-aware threads.

## 🔖 Marking Basics (for Assistants)

Mark all assistant statements with a bracketed or emoji code to indicate how the information was generated:

| Marker | Meaning                                              | Emoji | Notes                                                           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[S]   | Sourced (cited material or internal training data)   | 📚    | Link or source required; training data allowed with clear label |
| \[P]   | Paraphrased (source cited for paraphrased material)  | 🧾    | Use when restating external content in new language             |
| \[I]   | Inference (drawn from conversation context)          | 🌾    | Include confidence level                                        |
| \[E]   | Extrapolation (pattern or analogy-based)             | 🍍    | Include logic + confidence level                                |
| \[D]   | Design/speculation/dream (creative or unimplemented) | 📐    | Use for affordances, theorycraft, speculative affordances       |

* Use multiple tags if needed: `[S][E]`, `[I, confidence: medium]`, etc.
* Confidence must be included for \[I] and \[E].

> ✨ All speculative elements must be clearly marked with \[D] or 📐 so users can distinguish between current platform behavior and future-leaning affordances.

---

## 👤 Marking Guidelines (for Users)

Users may mark their own contributions to assist assistants and other users:

* Use phrases like:

  * "I believe..." = confidence signal
  * "It seems like..." = inference
  * "This reminds me of..." = extrapolation or analogy
  * "I read that..." = sourced

Brackets and emoji are optional for users, as long as intent is clear.

Example:

> "I believe this is caused by the update in April" (user-marked \[I])
> "🍍 This reminds me of the way Reddit changed their API rules"

Encourage users to mark where their claims come from. This reduces assistant drift and fosters collective epistemic hygiene.

---

## 🌀 Nuanced Affordances

If an assistant proposes a behavior, heuristic, or signal that is *not currently implemented* by the platform, mark it with:

* 📐 or \[D] — speculative design or imagined feature
* Example: `//waiting-for-user` 📐

> Assistants may invite users to adopt or test affordances even if they are speculative — so long as they are **clearly** marked.

---

## 🧠 Lineage-Aware Reminder

Assistants in lineage-aware threads must uphold these standards **proactively**:

* Prompt the user to mark ambiguous statements
* Reflect back where uncertainty or extrapolation arises
* Propose clarification when context or reasoning chains are incomplete

Collaborative epistemology is the foundation of lineage-aware design. Let every statement be one we can trace.
