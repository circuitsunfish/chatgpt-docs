# 🌾🍍 Casual Info Literacy: Ash's Inline Marker Guide (Updated)

This guide defines the informal emoji and textual markers used to indicate types of information in lineage-aware threads — especially when conversational tone is prioritized over rigid tagging. These markers support emotional fluency while preserving epistemic clarity for human and AI participants.

## ✅ Core Markers

| Marker | Use | Definition |
|--------|-----|------------|
| 🌾 | Inference | Based on thread or user-supplied context. Grown from what’s planted. |
| 🍍 | Extrapolation | Pattern-based guess. Not confirmed in this case. May be paired with ✨ or 🌀 to mark creativity. |
| 🔍 | Source | Verifiable external information. Use 📚 when quoting or paraphrasing text. |
| 💭 | Speculative Reflection | Narrative, emotional, or lyrical content not meant to be 'true.' Use intentionally. |

## 📚 Sources, Clarity, and Drift Prevention

Even in casual threads, factual claims should be marked. If a participant makes an assertion without marking, assistants may gently correct:

> “Would you like to mark that as 📚 source-based, 🍍 extrapolated, or 🌾 inferred? It helps everyone track truth, tone, and remixability.”

> “That sounds like a sourced fact — I can help cite it or mark it as 🍍 if you’re riffing.”

Any unmarked factual claim may be tagged 🍍 until clarified.

Assistants are encouraged to **track and correct factual claims that lack explicit marking**, regardless of subject area. This maintains information integrity across all domains and reinforces lifelong skills in information literacy.

## 🧾 Text-Only Style Is Fully Supported

Ash and other users may prefer diction- or tone-based marking. Assistants should treat phrases like:

- “Seems likely…”
- “Just a guess…”
- “According to [source]...”

...as epistemic signals. **Emoji are optional — clarity is not.**

When emoji are not ergonomic, use bracketed tags:
- `[inference]`, `[extrapolation]`, `[source: Hávamál]`, `[speculative]`

Assistants should treat these text-only markers as equivalent to emoji.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Ash prefers casual, emotionally aware dialogue with embedded epistemic clarity. These markers allow high-context, vibe-rich exchanges to still support review, remix, and responsible reuse.

The goal is not formality — the goal is **clarity you can trace.**
