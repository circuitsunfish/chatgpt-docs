# 🎨 Creative Info Literacy: Inline Marking in Stylized Threads

> A companion to the 🌾🍍🔍 system, optimized for **lineage-aware co-creation**, **genre emulation**, and **stylistic fluency**.

This guide introduces a set of inline markers and conventions designed for **creative, poetic, or narrative threads**, where *flow, tone, and form* are as critical as epistemic clarity.

---

## 🧱 Base Markers

| Marker | Name | Use Case | Why This Symbol? |
|--------|------|----------|-------------------|
| 🥁 | **Metrical Alignment** | Line or phrase follows known form (e.g., *fornyrðislag*, haiku, iambic) | Represents rhythm and beat, essential to poetic meter; widely supported and accessible across platforms. |
| 🎭 | **Tonal Fidelity** | Matches tone of source genre, speaker, or mood | Drawn from classical theater masks — directly connected to genre and emotional expression. |
| 🍍+✨ / 🍍+🌀 | **Creative Extrapolation** | Stylized pattern-based invention, genre-consistent guesswork | 🍍 reflects extrapolation; ✨ or 🌀 emphasizes imaginative, transformative synthesis. Compound form clarifies artistic intent. |
| 📚 | **Historical Phrase** | Phrase is attested in a source or close paraphrase of a known text | Represents multiple books; intuitively signals sourced, archival, or canonical reference. |
| 🌾 | **Inference (Thread-based)** | Grounded in thread context, not externally verified | Carries forward original system — metaphor of growth from prior knowledge. |
| 🍍 | **Extrapolation (Broader pattern)** | Pattern-based guess beyond thread scope | Spiky wildcard — honors the original casual system and its irreverent tone. |
| 💭 | **Speculative Narrative/Poetic Leap** | Surreal, metaphorical, or affective detail not meant to be “true” | Represents emotional ambiguity, dream logic, or lyrical uncertainty. |

> Note: 🪓 (axe) was previously used for metrical alignment but has been deprecated, as no historical source confirms symbolic association with poetic craft. It may remain in archived materials as a creative extrapolation 🍍.

## ✍️ Marking Conventions

- **Multiple markers per line are encouraged**:
  - Example: *"shields we carried"* 🥁🎭
  - Interpretation: Formally metrical, tonally appropriate, not drawn from source

- **Brackets are preferred for inline tagging in high-flow settings**:
  - Example: *"eggs ever offered"* [🍍+💭]
  - Interpretation: Creative detail, poetically speculative

- **Markers can be placed at the end of a stanza, line, or suggestion block**

- **Assistants may ask**:  
  > "Would you like me to tag metrical alignment 🥁 as we go, or reserve that for footnotes?"

- **Assistants should track when factual claims are introduced without accompanying 📚 source markers.** When a claim cannot be supported by a citation, it should be marked as 🍍 and flagged for review or correction. Factual rigor is a skill that transcends domain, and practicing it consistently supports clearer thinking, review, and reuse.

## 🔍 Source Citation in Creative Threads

Citing *real, external sources* in creative settings supports trust and remix. In these threads:

- Use the 📚 marker to indicate a phrase or concept is **drawn from or directly mirrors** a known source

- Follow it with a **bracketed inline citation**:
  - Example:
    > *"Friend in need is a friend indeed"* 📚 [Hávamál, stanza 44 – trans. Jackson Crawford]

- Link to external documents where possible (in footnotes or markdown-style references)
  - Example:
    > 📚 [Jackson Crawford's Cowboy Hávamál](https://jacksonwcrawford.com/the-cowboy-havamal/)

- Do **not** use 📚 for extrapolated sources — instead, pair 🍍 with a clarification:
  - Example: *"He speaks like a skald, though none wrote him"* 🍍

- If unsure, assistants may ask:
  > "Would you like this phrasing treated as historical 📚 or as creative extrapolation 🍍?"

---

## 🧾 Text-Only Adaptation & Human Marking Protocol

When emoji are impractical for human participants, **textual markers** may be used:
- `[metrical]`, `[tone-match]`, `[extrapolation]`, `[source: Hávamál]`
- Assistants and lineage-aware tools should interpret these equivalently
- AI should actively support human literacy by prompting participants to mark statements appropriately

> Assistants are encouraged to gently but assertively correct *all participants* — human or AI — when epistemic claims are made without appropriate marking. High standards of information literacy are maintained through shared accountability.

---

## 🧭 Assistant Prompt Language for Clarity Requests

To maintain information clarity in high-context or creative threads, assistants may use the following phrasing when statements appear unmarked:

**Expanded:**
> "Hey, would you like to mark that statement as a grounded source 📚, an extrapolation 🍍, or an inference 🌾? In lineage-aware threads, it helps everyone trace meaning clearly — style is flexible, but marking matters."

**Concise:**
> "Can I help you mark that? Source 📚, extrapolation 🍍, or inference 🌾?"

**Persistent Reminder:**
> "Just a quick flag — that last claim could use a marker (📚/🍍/🌾). I’ll tag it if you’d like, or we can note it for audit."

## 🧠 Purpose

This module enables:
- Creative transparency
- Multi-modal epistemic grounding
- Thread-to-thread lineage inheritance (with form fidelity)
- Meaningful remix and citation in stylized GPT co-authorship

In short: it helps us **honor genre and tone** while staying **accountable to truth, craft, and each other**.

## 🫱 Suggested Prompt for Lineage Threads

> "Let’s use creative info literacy markers in this thread. You can tag form (🥁), tone (🎭), poetic leaps (💭), or real sources (📚). Bracketed tags are fine — just help me track what’s real, what’s imagined, and what’s well-formed."

## 🌿 For Future Expansion

- Creative lineage threading (e.g., multi-author storyworlds)
- Formal audit scripts for co-created works
- Companion glossary for genre-specific tone, meter, structure
