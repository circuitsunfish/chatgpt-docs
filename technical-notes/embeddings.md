🧭 Learning Quest: Embeddings – Mapping Meaning in High Dimensions
📍 Quest Goal:
Understand how embeddings represent meaning in GPT models so you can explain, debug, and apply them in creative and technical workflows.
🔹 Stage 1: "What is an embedding?"
* ✅ Read: Definitions of embeddings from machine learning:
    * A high-dimensional vector that encodes the semantics of text
    * Similar meanings produce similar vectors
* 🔍 Visual Aid (included below): "Embeddings Space Map"
🔹 Stage 2: "Where are embeddings used?"
* ✅ Learn how embeddings are:
    * Generated at the input of GPT models
    * Used in tasks like search, recommendation, and classification
    * Queried via OpenAI's Embedding API for external apps
* 🧪 Practice:
    * Use a simple tool like OpenAI's Playground or a vector database demo (e.g., Pinecone)
🔹 Stage 3: "Why do they work for meaning?"
* ✅ Learn:
    * Embeddings are trained to predict next tokens — so they implicitly encode syntactic, semantic, and contextual signals
    * Words with similar usage patterns become nearby neighbors in space
* 🧠 Bonus:
    * Try to guess which pairs of words will be closer in embedding space and test your guesses with a semantic similarity demo
🏁 Complete When:
You can explain what an embedding is, what it’s for, and why high-dimensional space matters.

🧭 Learning Quest: Attention Heads – Architects of Reasoning
📍 Quest Goal:
Understand what attention heads do in GPT and how they support reasoning, context tracking, and relational understanding.
🔹 Stage 1: "What is attention?"
* ✅ Read: Summary of "self-attention" from the original transformer paper
    * Each token learns to focus on relevant other tokens
* 🔍 Visual Aid (included below): "Attention Head Focus Map"
🔹 Stage 2: "What do attention heads do?"
* ✅ Learn:
    * Each head sees the whole sequence but specializes in different relationships
    * Layers of heads stack, allowing complex structures to form
* 🧪 Practice:
    * Use AttentionViz to visualize how tokens attend to each other
🔹 Stage 3: "How does this power reasoning?"
* ✅ Learn:
    * Attention lets the model do flexible context management (tracking identities, references, time shifts)
    * Reasoning chains emerge when later layers re-interpret outputs of earlier heads
* 🧠 Bonus:
    * Try creating a prompt with complex references and have GPT explain how it resolved them
🏁 Complete When:
You can describe the role of attention heads in layered reasoning and dynamic focus.

📊 Visual Aids
🧩 Embeddings Space Map
   (Simplified 2D projection)

       "cat"     "kitten"
        o---------o
         \       /
          \     /      "dog"
           \   /        o
            \ /
           "pet"
              o

Far away:
   "car"     o

- Closer = more semantically similar
- Direction = conceptual similarity (e.g. gender, role, domain)
🕸️ Attention Head Focus Map
Input: "The fox who chased the rabbit was clever."

Head 3, Layer 2: Coreference
- "who" —> attends to —> "fox"
- "was" —> attends to —> "fox"

Head 6, Layer 8: Action tracking
- "chased" —> attends to —> "rabbit"
- "clever" —> attends to —> "fox"

Each head learns its own pattern!
