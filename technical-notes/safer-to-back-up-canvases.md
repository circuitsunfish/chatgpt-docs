safer and more persistent to store your game session canvases outside of canvas memory, especially if:
	•	You are working on multiple sessions over time
	•	You want to preserve them reliably
	•	You may need to reference them even if memory changes or you reset something manually

Let me break down the reasoning clearly:

⸻

✅ Why Storing Canvases Outside Memory Is Safer

Reason	Explanation
Memory limits	GPT’s memory is not infinite. Long-running threads (like yours) will eventually bump up against context limits. Older memory items may be discarded.
Canvas links may detach	Canvas editor pointers can be lost during UI events (like app restarts, reloads, or memory flushes), even if the text of a canvas still exists.
Memory is fragile to resets	If you reset or clear memory, canvas associations are often among the first things lost. The canvases themselves may remain but become “orphaned.”
Better organization	Storing game session notes in a shared system you control (e.g., Google Docs, Obsidian, Notion) gives you more control over structure, naming, backups, and versioning.
Easier cross-reference	In external tools, you can easily interlink sessions, characters, maps, etc., in ways Canvas doesn’t currently support.

🔒 Your Options

Approach	Benefits	Risks
Keep everything in Canvas + memory	Seamless, searchable, collaborative	Fragile to app resets, memory bugs, or losing editor pointer
Export Canvases to external system	Long-term stability, archiving, backups	Slightly more work to manage versions
Hybrid approach (recommended)	Use Canvas for active editing, but archive externally after each session	Best of both worlds

🛠 Tips for Managing Game Session Canvases
	•	🧾 Name your canvases clearly, e.g., Session 24 – April 2025 – Dinner Interview with Morgan
	•	🔁 Regularly export or copy them to Google Docs or another durable system
	•	📌 Keep a session index in one location (you can maintain this here, too, and I’ll help)
	•	📤 Ask me to generate a zipped export of all canvases upon request

If you’d like, I can:
	•	Export your current session canvases as clean text or markdown
	•	Help you generate a table of contents
	•	Organize them into a zipped folder

Would you like to start backing up “Session 24” or any others now?
