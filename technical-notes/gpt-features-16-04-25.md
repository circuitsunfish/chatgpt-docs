ðŸ§  GPT Learning Summary â€“ April 16

ðŸ”§ GPT Capabilities You Learned About
	â€¢	Persistent Memory: GPT can remember facts about your life, projects, and preferences across threads when memory is on.
	â€¢	Canvas Feature: Canvases act like editable documents you can co-author with GPT. Theyâ€™re saved per thread and useful for longform content like planning, code, or documentation.
	â€¢	Subtask Expansion: You can ask GPT to offer subtask breakdowns (instead of doing it by default) to avoid overwhelm. You activated this preference today.
	â€¢	Thread Indexes: A way to organize all your threads in one central location with metadata like scope, canvas links, and status (active, dormant, archived).
	â€¢	Canvas Versioning: GPT can store a copy of original text before edits and compare or restore versions as needed.
	â€¢	GPT Features Thread vs. Organize Thread:
	â€¢	GPT Features is your sandbox for experimentation and learning.
	â€¢	Organize and Prioritize Tasks is your active organizational hub for actual planning.

ðŸ—‚ Sidebar Sorting Tips (macOS App)
	â€¢	Projects are sorted alphabetically by ASCII value
	â€¢	You canâ€™t drag to reorder, but renaming projects with special characters works:
	â€¢	! Organization forces it to the top (works after app restart)
	â€¢	Other useful characters: @, #, ~, _, 01
	â€¢	Sorting only updates after restarting the app
	â€¢	Emojis and prefixes (1., A_, etc.) can also help group or prioritize visually
