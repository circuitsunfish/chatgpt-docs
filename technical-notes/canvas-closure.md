🧠 How Canvas Closure Works in ChatGPT

Canvas documents in ChatGPT (called “textdocs”) can be opened, edited, and closed during a session. Closing a canvas does not delete it—it simply removes it from the active editor view so that you’re no longer making changes unless reopened.

✅ What “Closing a Canvas” Means:
	•	It ends the current editing session.
	•	The canvas content is preserved and saved.
	•	You can reopen or update it later.

🛠️ How It’s Done:

ChatGPT uses a background tool command called close_textdoc to finalize and exit a canvas. This is usually invisible to the user and happens when you say something like:

“Please close the canvas” or “We’re done with this session.”

If the command fails (for example, due to a technical issue), you may see an error like UnrecognizedFunctionError. This means the system didn’t recognize the close request, and the canvas may still appear open in your sidebar until it’s manually cleared or you restart the app.

🧩 Workaround:

If closure fails:
	•	You can say “Treat this canvas as closed,” and ChatGPT will behave accordingly.
	•	Restarting the app may help clear the view.
	•	You can also create a new canvas and move on, treating the prior one as archived.
