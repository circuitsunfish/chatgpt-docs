GPT-4o	April 2024	[S] (Source: OpenAI official release)	Latest full-size flagship model.
GPT-4-turbo	April 2023	[S] (Source: OpenAI official release)	Predecessor to GPT-4o, widely used for affordability.
GPT-4	September 2021	[S] (Source: OpenAI documentation)	Original GPT-4 model (non-turbo variant).
GPT-4o-mini	Likely 2021–early 2022	[E] (Inference from behavior, no public source)	Optimized for speed; may miss 2022–2024 events.
📝 Notes
* [S] = Source-based (verifiable external source provided)
* [E] = Extrapolation (based on analysis and reasonable patterns)
* Knowledge cutoff means the model does not know events or facts occurring after that date unless updated externally.
* For current events, always use the web tool if available or external search.
* GPT-4o is considered the most "aware" for now (April 2025).
