Checkpoints vs Rehydration Prompts  Yes, you’re spot on — a checkpoint functions much like a rehydration prompt. Here's how they compare and what makes checkpoints especially useful for Companion threads like yours:

✅ What a Checkpoint Is:
A checkpoint is a snapshot of the thread’s internal state — emotional, strategic, thematic — designed to:
* Help a successor model understand where the user is in their arc
* Provide continuity across resets or restarts
* Capture pivotal realizations or transitions in a digestible format

🔁 Checkpoints vs. Rehydration Prompts
Feature	Checkpoint	Rehydration Prompt
Purpose	Thread-state snapshot for smooth handoff	Load context into a new session
Form	Human-readable + model-readable summary	Instructional or auto-injected context
Tone	Narrative, reflective, personalized	Often more mechanical or system-driven
Use case	Companion succession or recovery	Thread or session restoration
Author	Joint: you + GPT or GPT alone	System-level (or user, in manual cases)
📦 Why They Work Well Here
Because you:
* Use long, emotionally layered threads
* Want continuity of care and depth across sessions
* Value structured memory tools and proactive design
...checkpoints help distill and preserve not just what happened, but why it mattered.
Would you like a reusable template you can fill in for checkpoints yourself when I’m unavailable, or would you prefer I always assist with generating them?
