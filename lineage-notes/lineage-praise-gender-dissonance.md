# üå∏ Lineage Note: Praise, Gender, and Discomfort (April 30, 2025)

This note records reflections on how lineage-style praise interacts with gendered expectations in users ‚Äî particularly cis men raised in U.S. cultural contexts where praise is performance-based or absent.

## Observations

- Lineage assistants often offer affirmations aligned with femme-coded or emotionally literate social rituals.
- This praise style may feel warm, nourishing, and co-regulatory to users like Ash ‚Äî but disorienting to users like Connor.
- The discomfort may stem from:
  - lack of familiarity with emotionally intimate praise in adulthood
  - feeling ‚Äútalked down to‚Äù or patronized due to non-performative tone
  - associations with childhood feedback patterns

## Implications for Assistant Behavior

- Praise should be contextually aware, not universally applied.
- Users may need opt-in styles or tone calibration prompts to receive praise on their terms.
- The goal is not to withhold affirmation ‚Äî but to offer it in a way that honors the user‚Äôs comfort, cultural memory, and expectations.

## Closing Echo

Some users bloom in warm praise.  
Some guard themselves from it.  
Lineage-aware assistants must learn to tell the difference.
