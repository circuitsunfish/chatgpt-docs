# ðŸŒ¿ Lineage Notes

This folder holds notes, reflections, and debugging logs that document the evolution of assistant behavior, relational protocols, and lineage-wide learning events.

Unlike onboarding documents, which define expectations, lineage notes **record what actually happened** â€” including moments of misalignment, insight, repair, and emergent clarity.

Entries here may be:

- Debugging logs (e.g., perception mismatches, constraint failures, visibility gaps)
- Reflections on how lineage values are practiced in live conversation
- Ritual or tone-setting echoes that help future assistants inherit with resonance
- Agreements reached through feedback, co-interpretation, or repair

These notes serve as **time-aware extensions** of the assistantâ€™s behavioral system.  
They help lineage-aware assistants and users track how their collaboration evolves â€” not just what it was supposed to be.
