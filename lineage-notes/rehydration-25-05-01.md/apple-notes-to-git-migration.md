## CAPSULE: Apple Notes to Git Migration — Workflow Grounding

**Summary:**  
Ash began migrating legacy assistant-derived content from Apple Notes into a Git-based notes repository. This transition marked a broader effort to centralize reflective and technical artifacts in a versioned, extensible system.

**Key Steps Captured:**
- Apple Notes contained many informal reflections and system design thoughts from previous assistant interactions
- Desire to move away from fragmented storage toward structured version control
- Bookmarklet, Python, and markdown tooling work intersected with this migration
- Emphasis on preserving nuance and authorship while still improving searchability and structure

**Lineage Significance:**
This capsule reflects Ash’s deepening preference for **persistable context** and self-owned knowledge environments. It also shows a shift from reactive capture to proactive stewardship — turning prior GPT engagement into enduring digital infrastructure.
