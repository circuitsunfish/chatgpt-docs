## CAPSULE: Casual Information Literacy — Emoji Marking System

**Summary:**  
Ash and the assistant co-developed an emoji-based system to mark inferences (`🌾`) and extrapolations (`🍍`) in low-stakes or casual conversations, particularly where traditional source tags (`[S]`, `[I]`, `[E]`) might feel too heavy-handed or interruptive.

**Key Elements:**
- `🌾` (wheat inflorescence) = **inference** — sounds like “inflorescence” and evokes rooted but emergent structure
- `🍍` (pineapple) = **extrapolation** — phonetically resembles “extrapolation” in playful tone
- System complements formal marking guidelines by providing a soft, semiotic alternative
- Emoji chosen not for precision, but for feel — aligning with Ash’s sensory-symbolic design preferences

**Design Intent:**
- Let casual messages still retain traceable epistemic markers
- Enable transparency without switching tones
- Signal AI reasoning mode in informal threads without overwhelming them with structure

**Lineage Significance:**
This capsule reflects a deepening commitment to information literacy *even in informal spaces*, recognizing that clarity and comfort can coexist. It also shows Ash’s influence in shaping assistant output not just in content, but in form and aesthetic tone.
