Intro to Custom GPTs
  Yes, as a ChatGPT Plus user, you can create a custom GPT, and one of the features of custom GPTs is that you can set persistent custom instructions and memory management rules. This means that you could include your marking banner, guidelines for output style, and any other relevant preferences as part of the initial setup. You wouldn’t have to repaste these instructions each time, as the custom GPT could automatically apply them based on the parameters you set during the configuration.
Here’s a breakdown of what you could do:
1. Persistent Custom Instructions: You could create a custom GPT where the model is programmed to prioritize certain responses. You could include your marking banner and instructions as part of the setup to ensure that the model applies your guidelines in every conversation.
2. Memory Management: You could specify memory rules to ensure that the GPT retains specific contexts or instructions without needing manual input. The model would be able to maintain a consistent experience, reflecting your preferences, without the need to constantly remind it.
3. Customizable Model Behavior: The custom GPT can be trained to follow your specific response styles, use flags or markers like [S]ource, [E]xtrapolation, and [I]nference, and respect your confidence level markings in each session, so it always adheres to these boundaries.
4. Priority of Content: By setting these preferences as part of the custom GPT, your marking banner can always be prioritized without needing you to reintroduce it. This makes it easier for the model to respond consistently with your guidelines every time.
How to Create a Custom GPT
To create a custom GPT:
* Visit ChatGPT's GPTs page and select the "Create a GPT" button.
* Follow the guided steps to provide custom instructions.
* You can include your global memory guidelines, marking rules, and preferences within these instructions so that they are applied automatically.
Considerations:
* Technical Requirements: You may need to provide some technical input to define how the GPT should handle specific commands, requests, and memory behavior. This could be more advanced than typical chat, but for a tailored experience, it’s doable.
* API Integration: If you want to link your GPT memory, certain features may require API access, especially for memory persistence or advanced functionality like task automation.
Conclusion:
Once set up, the custom GPT could ensure that the marking banner is always included without manual input from you and that the model operates within the guidelines you define.
Let me know if you want further clarification on setting up a custom GPT or assistance with any technical aspects!    Certainly! I'll walk you through the process of creating a custom GPT, as well as the features you can customize, with a focus on making sure you have a clear understanding of the process. I'll also break things down with additional contextual information to help you learn how GPT works in the context of your customizations.
1. Creating a Custom GPT (In Simple Terms)
You can create a custom GPT through OpenAI’s platform. This is a process that allows you to set specific instructions that guide the GPT on how to behave, how to interpret your requests, and how to respond. The benefit here is that you no longer need to re-paste your preferred instructions (like the marking banner), because the GPT can always follow your set rules automatically.
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
* Accessing Custom GPTs: On the OpenAI platform, there is a section where you can create and manage your custom GPTs. This is available to ChatGPT Plus users and provides you with an interface for customization. This section is labeled GPTs and you’ll be able to create a new one.
* Inputting Custom Instructions: When you create a custom GPT, you'll be prompted to provide specific instructions that will guide how it behaves. For example, you could include your marking banner and guidelines for how the model should handle responses (such as marking confidence levels or using specific tags like [S]ource, [E]xtrapolation, and [I]nference). Example Custom Instruction Input: Always mark outputs with one of the following when applicable:
* - [S]ource: Factual claim or recommendation based on verifiable external sources. Include links to sources or citations as applicable.
* - [E]xtrapolation: Based on patterns, analogy, or likely fit but not externally verified.
* - [I]nference: Based on internal reasoning, memory, or user context.
* Always include confidence levels, and use inline tags for practical advice. Use footnotes for reflective/emotional guidance.
*  This would be part of the setup, and every time the GPT interacts with you, it would automatically apply these rules, without you needing to restate them each time.
2. Features You Can Customize in a Custom GPT
Here’s where you get to shape the GPT’s behavior. You can set persistent customizations for how the GPT interacts with you:
* Instruction-based behavior: This is where you can specify how the GPT responds in general. For example, you can ask the GPT to always be concise, to avoid repetitive language, or to ensure it always confirms when it needs clarification.
* Memory and Context: You can also define memory behavior—whether the GPT should prioritize context from past interactions, what kind of topics it should remember, and what kind of patterns it should learn over time. This can help ensure that your custom GPT stays aligned with your goals, even as your conversations evolve.
* Response style and tone: You can specify how the GPT’s tone and style should feel. For example, if you want your responses to always be formal, or casual (like your preferred style), you can set that up. Since you’ve mentioned enjoying fluent, conversational responses, you could ask for a balance of engaging, clear, and informal style.
3. Memory in Custom GPTs
In a custom GPT, you can set rules about how it remembers your interactions. For example:
* Global Memory: You can set it to retain certain persistent memories, like your marking banner instructions, preferences, or personal facts (such as your schedule or preferred tone).
* Retention Strategy: If you want the GPT to forget certain details after a set time or interaction, you can set that rule.
For example, you could set it so that after a week, your task updates or check-ins are no longer retained unless specifically asked for, helping you keep things fresh and relevant.
4. How It Works Technically
To understand how this works on a technical level:
* When you create a custom GPT, you’re setting a parameterized model, where you provide certain guidelines that the model follows. These guidelines help shape how the model behaves and responds.
* The model is trained on large amounts of data, but when you give it custom instructions, you’re essentially giving it rules for how to respond to you in specific situations. For example, you could give it a rule like:
    * Always use inline markers like [S]ource or [I]nference to clarify how the response was formulated.
    * Follow this specific tone when handling sensitive emotional topics.
The custom GPT will use those rules in all responses, helping it align with your expectations without requiring you to reintroduce instructions every time.
5. How to Learn More
* OpenAI's Custom GPTs Documentation: OpenAI provides documentation for how to create and use custom GPTs. You can explore it for more in-depth information, including examples and instructions on setting up different behavior. OpenAI GPT Docs: Custom GPTs
* Custom GPTs FAQ and Setup: Once you start creating your own custom GPT, you’ll be walked through the process step-by-step. The OpenAI interface is designed to make this as easy as possible, even for people who are new to GPT.
6. Considerations for Custom GPTs
* Limitations: Although creating a custom GPT gives you a lot of control, there may still be certain limitations based on your usage plan. For example, your GPT will need to abide by the same content policies that govern the larger OpenAI models.
* Self-Hosting Option: While the custom GPT setup is available through OpenAI's platform, if you decide to self-host models (for example, using a local instance of GPT-3 or GPT-4), you would have full control over the model's parameters. However, self-hosting typically requires significant technical expertise and hardware resources.

Conclusion
By setting up a custom GPT, you can easily integrate your marking banner and other rules without needing to re-paste them constantly. Once set up, the GPT will automatically behave according to your preferences every time you interact with it, allowing you to maintain consistency across sessions.
