# ðŸ“š Repo Review Kit

This folder supports lightweight, structured reviews of my living repositories (blog posts, GPT notes).

- Snapshots capture the state of the repo at review time.
- Prompts guide GPT to generate roadmaps, project management strategies, and meta improvements.
- Reviews record GPT's feedback and help shape future growth.

This system is meant to remain modular, soft-paced, and resonant with the project's evolving needs.
