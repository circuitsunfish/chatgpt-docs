## üîç Inputs
- Tree snapshot: 2025-04-tree.txt
- Sampled files:
  - 2025-04-sample-gpt-features-successor-onboarding.md
  - 2025-04-sample-gpt-features-17-04-25.md
  - 2025-04-sample-canvas-memory-app-behavior.md
- Tag harvest: Present (limited)

## üóÇÔ∏è 1. Major Topic Clusters Identified
- **Technical Behavior Notes** (e.g., GPT memory, canvas issues, app troubleshooting)
- **Meta-Project Structuring** (e.g., onboarding, review protocols)
- **Custom GPT Usage Experiments** (e.g., notes-tagger prototype)
- **Creative Expansion Seeds** (creative-notes, future-plans)
- **Reflections on Usage Style** (workflow, app behavior, memory resilience)

---

## üõ§Ô∏è 2. Suggested Roadmap Expansions
- Expand lightweight tagging across Markdown files.
- Begin soft crosslinking across thematically related posts.
- Regularize snapshot capture (monthly or milestone-tied).
- Prototype simple tagging automation in `experiments/notes-tagger`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Structural or Meta Improvements Proposed
- Add `index.md` to meta-notes/ summarizing contents.
- Lighten onboarding document into a \"quick-start\" version if successor handoffs increase.
- Formalize a short `snapshots/README.md` if desired.

---

## üå± 4. Emergent Opportunities
- Treat system-building process itself as a future public article.
- Explore narrative/seasonal structures for organizing technical material.
- Consider publishing partial review cycles publicly when ready.

---

## üß† System Health Assessment
- **Structure:** Strong and scalable
- **Thematic Coherence:** High
- **Growth Readiness:** Ready for soft expansions
- **Resilience:** Excellent foundational systems in place
