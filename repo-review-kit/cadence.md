# ðŸŒ± Review Cadence

- **Monthly**: Light roadmap check (clusters, gaps, emergent themes)
- **Quarterly**: Full meta-audit (structure, navigation, publishing cadence)
- **After major cluster closure**: Reflective crosslinking and lore weaving

Each review should feel like tending a living garden, not conducting an audit.
